# Public Service Delivery {auto-animate="true" link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83" height=100}

- Do diminishing public services create political grievances that increase support for right-wing populism?
  - Literature on the drivers of populism have focused primarily on economic [@margalit2019economic] and cultural grievances [@norris2019cultural]
  - Much less work on how direct experiences with poor public service provision may affect support for the populist right
- If public service decline creates grievances, how do voters respond?
  - Do they punish the incumbent?
  - Do they shift to the party that "owns" the issue of public services?
  - Do they shift to the populist right?
  - Are the effects of declines conditioned by other factors, such as immigration?


# Public Service Delivery {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}


- Public service delivery is a core function of the state
  - Key to the social contract between representatives and voters [@besley2020state]
  - Key to the legitimacy of the state [@levi1988rule]
  - Key to the quality of life of citizens [@vogler2023]
- Public services are often the primary means through which citizens interact with and learn about the state's performance
  - Even citizens uninterested or uninformed about politics are likely to have direct experiences with public services



# The argument {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}


- Declines in public service delivery can generate public dissatisfaction and grievances 
- Shift to the populist right can occur for several reasons:
  - As a protest vote against the establishment for failure to uphold the social contract
  - When linked with cultural arguments about competition for scarce public services with immigrants
    - Validates the populist right’s anti-immigrant rhetoric


# Theoretical Expectations {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83" font-size="2em" font-type="serif"}

1. Declining public services will reduce patients' reported experiences 
2. Declining public services will increase support for the populist right among affected voters 
  3. The effects of declining public services will be more pronounced when such declines can be linked to an increase in immigration



# The British Context {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}


- The UK's **National Health Service** (NHS) is a universal health service, free at the point of care
- The NHS is a core public service that is highly salient to voters
- The NHS has been under increasing strain in recent years
  - Facilities closures
  - Staff shortages
  - Long waiting times

![](images/brexit_bus.png){.absolute .fragment bottom="100" right="0" align="bottom" width="350" height="250"}

- The NHS has been a key issue in recent elections/referenda
- Valence issue – vast majority of citizens favour the NHS, and higher spending on the NHS
- All parties favour the NHS in its current form (including populist right parties)

# Data {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}

- GP practice closures in England from NHS Digital
- GP-Patient Survey from Ipsos 
  - Practice-level data on patient experience and satisfaction
- Understanding Society Panel (Secure Access)
- British Election Study Panel 
- Annual data on migration from Office of National Statistics (ONS)

# Causal Identification {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}


- We want to identify the causal effect of experiencing a GP practice closure on outcomes of interest
  - Yet, closures are not random (recruitment issues, health outcomes, etc.)
  - We need to control for confounding factors
- **Treatment group:** individuals in areas where a GP practice has closed
- **Control group:** individuals in areas where a GP practice has not **yet** closed
- We use a staggered difference-in-differences design
  - Geographic and Temporal Variation













# Treatment & Control Groups {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"} 

- We compare outcomes among individuals in areas that experience a closure to outcomes in areas where individuals have not **yet** experienced a closure

# GP Practice Closures {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"} 

- Millions of patients have been affected by practice closures

# Estimation {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- We estimate the effect of GP practice closures on outcomes of interest using a variety of estimation strategies:
  + Matrix Completion [@athey2021matrix]
  + Interactive Fixed Effects [@bai2009panel]
  + Mahalanobis Matching [@imai2023matching]
  + Covariate-balancing Propensity Score Matching [@imai2014covariate]
  + Random Forests (for heterogenous treatment effects)

# Results {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}


Results are presented as event series plots, where the event is the closure of a GP practice and the y-axis is the estimated coefficient at time *t* relative to the event

# Conditional Treatment Effects {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- The effects of declining public services are more pronounced when such declines can be linked to an increase in immigration 
- When voters perceive that immigrants are competing for scarce public services, they are more likely to shift to the populist right
  - This is consistent with the populist right's anti-immigrant and nativist rhetoric 


# How Does UKIP Frame NHS Declines? {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- We use topic modeling to identify press releases from the UK Independence Party (UKIP) that mention the NHS

## Heterogenous Treatment Effects {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- Most important features predicting a switch to the populist right using Random Forests
- Annual data from ONS on migration and the number of migrants registering at a GP practice for the first time

# Conclusions {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}


- Robust evidence that direct experience with deteriorating public services increases support for the populist right
- Rather than shifting support to the party that "owns" the issue of public services (e.g. Labour), voters turn against 'mainstream' parties
- Populist right parties can capitalize on dissatisfaction with public service delivery to increase their support
  - Particularly when the decline in public services can be linked to an increase in immigration 
  - anti-establishment, anti-immigrant/nativist rhetoric


- **Key Takeaway:** In addition to economic and cultural factors, we should also consider how poor performance of core public services fuels populist right support
